### Fields
* Id (Guid, PK)
* Username (string, unique)
* Email (string, unique)
* PasswordHash (string)

  * A ClusterAdmin can be associated with one User (UserId) who has the ClusterAdmin role
### Fields

* CheckedOutBy (Guid, FK to Users table where Role is LobbyPersonnel, nullable)
* Notifications (collection of Notification entities)
* Note: VisitorName, VisitorEmail, and VisitorPhoneNumber fields are stored in the Visit entity to capture the visitor's information at the time of the visit, even if the invite was based on a pre-approved invite. This allows for accurate record-keeping and reporting of visits, as well as providing necessary information for notifications and audits.

## Notification
* Table: Notifications

* Message (string)
* IsRead (bool)
* CreatedAt (DateTimeOffset)
* Note: The Notification entity is designed to store notifications related to visits, such as visit check-ins, check-outs, invite approvals, and rejections. The RecipientId field allows for efficient querying of notifications for a specific user, while the VisitId field allows for tracking notifications related to a specific visit. The IsRead field can be used to filter unread notifications for users, and the CreatedAt field can be used for sorting and retention purposes. A retention plan can be implemented to automatically delete notifications after a certain period (e.g., 365 days) to manage storage and comply with data retention policies.

# TODOs
* Define the entities and relationships
* Define the logical data model for entities
* Define UI screens
* Define project scope exclusions to avoid scope creep
* Define application processes as user stories
* Define how to store notifications for efficient querying and also define retention plan
* Mention usage of blazor datatables to render paginated lists
